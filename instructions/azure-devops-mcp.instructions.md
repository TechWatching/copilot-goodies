# Azure DevOps MCP Server Instructions

When using Azure DevOps MCP Server you should always follow these instructions:

-   Before creating new work items, check other work items to understand the naming convention for title, the work items fields and tags used, and follow the same pattern.
-   When updating a work item in Azure DevOps you should always retrieve the latest version of the work item before making any changes. This ensures that you are working with the most up-to-date information and helps prevent conflicts or overwriting changes made by others.
-   When you create or update a work item, always give me the URL to the updated work item after the operation is complete.
-   When creating or updating work items, ensure that all required fields are filled out accurately and completely
-   When creating a work item, always set the description field to use markdown format instead of HTML or plain text.
-   Ensure you have correctly linked the related work items, especially parent-child relationships.
